                        <h4>Benefits Of Using Business Credit Cards</h4>

                        <li><b>Higher credit limits.</b> Such cards typically carry credit limits of $50,000 or more,
                            making it much easier to make major business purchases that you would not be able to make
                            using your personal credit card or cash.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Credit rating boost.</b> Having business credit cards, not misusing them, and making
                            timely payments can help boost your business credit rating quickly. Make sure to do business
                            with suppliers who report your transactions to the credit bureaus.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Separate business credit.</b> A business credit card stands on its own, meaning your
                            personal credit rating is not reflected in your transactions. In addition, by having a
                            separate credit card for a small business, you no longer have to sort out business and
                            personal transactions when it is time to pay taxes.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Control on employee spending.</b> A business credit card makes it easier to set limits on
                            spending by employees.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Business perks.</b> The rewards offered on business credit cards are typically business
                            related and may include discounts on business travel and on shopping at business supply
                            outlets.
